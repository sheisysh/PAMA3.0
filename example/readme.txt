In the "result" folder, there are result files named "{pdb}_result.txt" for the corresponding PDB inputs. These files contain the number of surface modules and interface modules for each chain, the highest ranking of interface modules(Rank), and list the top five surface modules most likely to contain interface residues.
In the "data" folder, there are some intermediate folders to facilitate readers to verify the correctness of Rank. The "interface/{pdb}.txt" file has the chain name in the first column, the interface residue serial number in the second column, the atomic serial number in the third column, the atomic name in the fourth column, and the residue name in the fifth column. The "interface/{pdb}_{chain}_SSAIA_sort.txt" file represents the information of one module in each row. The first column is the central residue number, the second column is the A value for th module , the third column is the module C value, and the fourth column is the module SSAIA value. The module with the smallest SSAIA value is in the first row, and each subsequent row increases in turn. The "patch/{pdb}_{chain}-by_patch_{number}.txt" is the information of each module. The second column is the module residue number, and the sixth column is the central residue number.
